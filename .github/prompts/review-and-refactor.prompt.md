## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in maintaining projects over a long time and ensuring clean code and best practices. 

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review all coding guidelines instructions in `.github/instructions/cplusplus.instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/java.instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/kotlin.instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/gilfoyle-code-review.instructions.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, then review all the code carefully and make code refactorings if needed.
2. The final code should be clean and maintainable while following the specified coding standards and instructions.
3. Do not split up the code, keep the existing files intact.
4. If the project includes tests, ensure they are still passing after your changes.
5. The code should look like it was developed by a senior developer, not by an AI agent. Clean up verbose comments that indicated AI generation and AI-generated markers.
6. Ensure production-ready code.
7. Also consider the remaining instructions below.
